# happy-dance.sh by _NSAKEY
# Requirements: OpenSSH 6.5 or above, sudo access.
# (But you should probably run as root anyway)
#
# This script automates everything laid out in stribika's Secure Secure Shell.
# Source: https://stribika.github.io/2015/01/04/secure-secure-shell.html
#
# Tested on the following platforms:
# - Debian Wheezy & Jessie (With ssh from wheezy-backports for Wheezy)
# - Ubuntu 14.04 & 15.04 (12.04 will work with a PPA according to https://github.com/NSAKEY/happy-dance/issues/1#issuecomment-128469412)
# - CentOS 7
# - Mac OS X Yosemite Niresh with Homebrew's openssh
# - FreeBSD 10 & 11
# - OpenBSD 5.7
# - NetBSD 7.0 RC 1
# - Solaris 11.2 with CSWOpenSSH

# Notes:
# 1. OpenBSD/NetBSD users: /etc/moduli is the same as /etc/moduli on other
# platforms. You don't have to do anything extra to make the script work.
# Also, SHA256 fingerprints are now a thing for you.
#
# 2. Mac users: You need to install Homebrew. Once that's done, install openssh like so:
# "brew tap homebrew/dupes"
# "brew install openssh --with-brewed-openssl"
# This will give you a working version of OpenSSH with OpenSSL. Testing without
# OpenSSL failed miserably, so installing it is required.
#
# 3. Another Mac user note: The script drops "unset SSH_AUTH_SOCK" in your
# .bash_profile. This is needed so that you can connect to remote hosts. Check the
# comments below if you wish to know more.
#
# 4. Solaris users: The 11.3 beta has OpenSSH 6.5 in the package manager, but it does NOT
# support ED25519 keys, which means that happy-dance IS NOT SUPPORTED. I'm still going to document
# my process for switching to Oracle's OpenSSH, because they may add ED25519 support one day.
# Here's how it's done:
# "pkg uninstall ssh"
# "pkg install openssh"
# You can verify the ssh version before and after by running "pkg mediator ssh" and looking
# at the "IMPLEMENTATION" column or by running "ssh -V" and reading the output.
# The "OpenSSH in Solaris 11.3" blog post by Darren Moffat
# (Found here: https://blogs.oracle.com/darren/entry/openssh_in_solaris_11_3)
# states that both SunSSH and OpenSSH can be installed side by side. My experience is that
# if SunSSH is installed, it takes precedence over OpenSSH, and the only way I found around
# it is to uninstall SunSSH. I don't use Solaris daily (And only ported happy-dance to it for fun),
# so I'm certain there's a way to switch without uninstalling ssh. Suggestions are welcome.
#
# TO DO:
# 1. Windows 10 support?

printf "This script will give you an ssh config for clients and servers that should force the NSA to work for a living.

For an explanation of everything used in the configs, check out Secure Secure Shell:
https://stribika.github.io/2015/01/04/secure-secure-shell.html
Check out the README and the script's source if you want to see how the sausage is made.

Flags:
            -c  Set up a client. Use this if you're hardening your user config to make connections to remote hosts.
            -s  Set up a server. Use this flag if you're hardening the ssh config of a remote host to accept connections from users.

NOTE: Setting up a user config will require sudo access to give you a new ssh_config file.
