# happy-dance.sh by _NSAKEY
# Requirements: OpenSSH 6.5 or above, sudo access.
# (But you should probably run as root anyway)
# Tested on the following platforms:
# - Debian Wheezy & Jessie (With ssh from wheezy-backports for Wheezy)
# - Ubuntu 14.04 & 15.04
# - CentOS 7
# - Mac OS X Yosemite Niresh with brew's openssh
# - FreeBSD 10 & 11
# - OpenBSD 5.7
# - NetBSD 7.0 RC 1
# - Solaris 11.2 with CSWOpenSSH

# Notes:
# 1. OpenBSD/NetBSD users: /etc/moduli is the same as /etc/moduli on other
# platforms. You don't have to do anything extra to make the script work.
# Also, SHA256 fingerprints are now a thing for you.
# 2. Mac users: You need to install brew. Once that's done, install openssh like so:
# "brew install openssh --with-brewed-openssl"
# I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that Apple's TLS library won't work.
# 3. Another Mac user note: The script drops "unset SSH_AUTH_SOCK" in your
# .bash_profile. This is needed so that you can connect to remote hosts. Check the
# comments below if you wish to know more.

# TO DO:
# 1. Eventually rework the configs to support new options in OpenSSH,
# like FingerprintHash in 6.8 and ChaCha20-poly1350@openssh.com in 6.9.
